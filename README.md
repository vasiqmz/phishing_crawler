# phishing_crawler
Description:
    The entire purpose of this project is to crawl anti-phishing websites - VirusTotal, PhishTank, Cymon - and provide the status of the website back to the user.
     The input is taken in a file that contains each website per-line and then it crawls the aforementioned anti-phishing sites.
     
 Currently the work is in progress and I'll be updating the repository from time-to-time.
